# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

App that allows the user to generate random romance novel covers, save them onto the app, and to make their own unique cover with text inputs. This app is solving the problem of needing to create and save new romance book covers. It's an easier, more accesible way to create new romance covers. Otherwise, user would have to manually find and combine elements to make their own cover.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Clone down the repo using GitHub. GitHub provides a link which can be used in the terminal after typing `github clone <cloned link from GitHub>`.

2. Enter the respective directory in the terminal. Then type `open index.html` to open the website in an internet browswer.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)
When a user generates a book cover by making their own unique cover or generating a random one, they should be able to view all of the covers that they have saved by clicking the 'View Saved Covers' button. All of the saved covers should be shown as a gallery.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We worked on this project for six days. We are both two weeks into Mod 1. This was our first partner project.

- Slack

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

**Wins:**
- Great teammwork/collaboration.
- Implementing new concepts such as the target property.

**Challenges:**
- We encountered bugs due to poorly worded variables. This took some time to identify and resolve the errors and it was difficult to understand what was happening due to the naming of variables. To resolve this, we used Dev Tools to console log to find the disconnects throughout our code.
- We found ourselves tired from staring at screens from time to time. To resolve this, we took poms and checked in verbally with eachother to see if we needed a break or some solo work time.
