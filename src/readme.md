# Rock, Paper, Scissors  

### Abstract:

This app allows the user to play a classic version of rock, paper, scissors, and a spicy version that adds lizard and alien characters. The user plays against a randomized computer opponet. The app maintains a data model of wins for the person and computer. 

### Installation Instructions:

1. Go to [this repo](https://github.com/nalito223/rock-paper-scissors-) on Github
2. Click Fork > Create New Fork
3. Click Code
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type git clone and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in text editor
8. Type open index.html in the terminal
9. Manipulate the application in the browser window

### Preview of App:
I would like to highlight the "Choose your fighter!" view of the spicy version. I used flex box to orient the UI and CSS transitions so the clickable images would expand on hover.

### Learning Goals:

**Learning Goals:**
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

**Tech Used:**
- GitHub
- Terminal
- VS Code 
- Chrome Browser/Dev tools

### Wins + Challenges:

**Wins:**
- Successful implementation of flex box 
- Advanced implementation of CSS to improve user experience
- Data model is separate and updated before the DOM 
- Utilized class to class interaction 

**Challenges:**
- It was a good learning challenge to make the data model and gameplay function in the console before setting up the DOM.
- Refactoring to adhere to DRY and SRP practices.
